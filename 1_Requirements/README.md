## Introduction
* Airline Ticket Reservation System: The following system is a prototype which allows an individual to book a Airline ticket online through our Application and also it has many privileges which are a choice to the particular individual.
It Will be able to do the following:
1. Allows users to book tickets online.
2. Had a priviledge of Early Check-in, class and seat preference.
3. Had a priviledge of ordering the food at the time of booking itself.


## Research
* Being an Electronic student who had a less scope on programming always wondered how a booking application is built.For me especially coding became a worst nightmare but due to intrest using the basic programming language which is 'C' helped me to build this application.

* In science and technology, the desire for improvement is a constant subject which triggers
advancements. This is visible in every ramification and the airline industry is not an exemption.
Airline reservation systems were first introduced in the late 1950s as relatively simple standalone
systems to control flight inventory, maintain flight schedules, seat assignments and aircraft
loading. Today modern airline reservation systems are comprehensive suites of products to
provide systems that assist with a variety of airline management tasks and service customer
needs from the time of initial reservation through completion of the flight.

### Benefits
The system has the following benefits:
#### Easy and Flexible online reservations can be done
It has often seen that airline ticket booking is difficult task to do and also doing the Early check-in is a seperate task as well as food ordering.This System solves all these problems by bring all the tasks together and saves a lot of time to the user.
#### Ease of Booking
* Ticket Booking, Early Check-in and Food ordering is a not a rocket science anymore our appliction provides that ease to any user to do all the tasks very easily.

### WHO 
 The project can be used almost by all. user satisfaction is the goal  of the project.
### WHAT
Booking the ticket and some the basics privileges are included in the project. User can use the program efficiently and get the required results.

### WHEN
The project can be used at the time of Booking Airline Tickets 
and get the Ticket Confirmation. The result will be obtained quickly.

### WHERE
In all the domains it can be used. As the project is portable and user-friendly, it can be easily implemented on the mobile systems and pPCs. It should overcome all the drawbacks of the Old existing system and most important of all meet the user requirements.

### HOW
System design is a solution for “HOW TO” approach to the creation of a new system. It translates system requirements into ways by which they can be made operational. It is a translational from a user oriented document to a document oriented programmers. For that, it provides the understanding and procedural details necessary for the implementation. Here UML diagrams are used to supplement the working of the new system. The system thus made should be reliable, durable and above all should have least possible maintenance costs.
